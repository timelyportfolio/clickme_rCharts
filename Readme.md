## rCharts combined with clickme

While rCharts shiny and slidify capabilities are very special and amazing, I think it would also be very nice to produce a standalone HTML page.  I can see two methods of accomplishing this:

1.  Use Slidify to create a one page slide as our HTML page.
2.  Add some of the abilities from [clickme](http://github.com/nachocab/clickme).

I put this example together as an example of using both clickme and rCharts.  However it loses the ability to expand {{ }} in the portion of the document.
